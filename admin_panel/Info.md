## Info 
- Want to make a challenge where there is LIMITED code execution.
	- To the point where multiple writes are needed in order to do this. 
- How to force multiple writes? 
	- Limit the amount of characters that can be written (9?)
	- Blacklist of items such (/bin/sh, cat, etc.) 
- Unsure whether to make this a web challenge or a binary challenge: 
	- Web: 
		- Annoying to script 
		- Most time consuming 
	- Binary: 
		- Easier to write securely 
- Options: 
	- Edit your computer...
		- Change MAC: Have a VERY limited RCE on this (char limit with some blacklisting)
		- Change distro 
		- Change current username 
		- WiFi settings
		- etc.
 	- Show current settings
