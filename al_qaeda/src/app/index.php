   <h1> <center>Al Qaeda</center></h1>
    <p>
    Our job is to fight for Muslims worldwide. We need to keep our ideology intact and fight for those who cannot fight. <br/>
    We know that the Muslim culture is the right way. <br/>
    We need to defeat the enemy, the ones corrupting all of our morals: the <b>United States.</b> <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    Help us plan to end the country that is opposing the Muslim way the most. This way, we can live free and happy lives.
