# Astros 
- The Houston Astros were caught stealing signs in professional baseball. 
- So, for a fun miscellanous challenge, I thought it would be fun to have a program that would randomly generate a set of "sign's". 
- Then, have the student attempt to figure out how the signs are being given. 
- Do this correctly 10 times, and you win :)

## Signs 
- Amount of touches on a single part of the face (the count) to get the pitch 
- **Indicator** (next n signs afterwards is the pitch) 
- Pitches: 
	- Fastball 
	- Change Up 
	- Curveball 
	- Knuckleball
