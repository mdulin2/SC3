# Challenge

- "Hey man... I found a vulnerability in how a bank handles money! Want to break the system with me? We can be like robinhood and give it back to the poor."
- "Or, we can buy ferrari's and drive off in to the sunset". 
- The goal of this exercise is to break the bank and steal money from it. Enjoy :) 

- Hint: Floating point numbers are real hard! https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)FloatingPoint.html
