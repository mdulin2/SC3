Let's take a look at JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)!

Given:  
* IP for the service.  
* Source code (optional, they shouldn't need it but redact flags if this is given)

* Flag1: What does logging in give you access to?  
* Flag2: What's inside the JWT?  
* Flag3: Can you make or modify your own token? I wonder if you can brute force this? John the ripper is great!
