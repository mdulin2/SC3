## Challenge

Servers, servers, everywhere... but are they secure?
HINT: What is a REALLY bad password for the *root* user?

## Given
- IP for the service running from `docker_compose.yml`
- _None of the files should be given_

## Hints
- It's a bird! It's a plane! No -- it's weak credentials on the FTP server!
- The notes in the FTP server seem to be littered with clues.
