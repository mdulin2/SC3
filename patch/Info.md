## Patch 
- The goal is to ensure that the students patch a file and send this to the server (then, the code is executed).
- How (with safety): 
	- Send the binary to a server (with pre-built scripts) 
	- Do a check on the byte similarity (only allow 10 bytes of difference?) 
- If the bytes are VERY similar, the code should run okay.
